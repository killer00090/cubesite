        <h1>This site is currently under maintenance!</h1>
        I am working to fix all bugs and I am currently seeing and redesigning the site as a whole!
        This may take a while so if you were using this site as a way to learn then you may want to look for something else. Sorry.
         I am also looking to make a video you can watch where I go through the whole site and help you see what I'm "telling you."
            Unfortunatly for anyone who wants to see this, I have extended the waiting period to the end of july due to personal things, I will begin working on july 16, as I am taking a  much needed break.
        <br>Sorry for the inconvinience
        </p>
